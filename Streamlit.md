## History and Significance
- Founded in 2018 by data engineers at Google

- Their team kept making scripts ad hoc to visualize their data
- Sharing their insights required screenshotting or making a full-stack web app!
- What if an engineer could build a UI in a few lines of code?
## Under the Hood
- Uses React.js for frontend rendering

- User writes the script, Streamlit connects it to browser with WebSocket, then listens for input
## Capabilities
- Very basic -> text / widgets / media / layout options

- Visualization support for matplotlib, seaborn, plotly, pandas, etc.
    - Visualize the data from your TensorFlow or PyTorch outputs!
- Connect to cloud databases if you'd like
- In short, it has everything you'll need
## Uses
- ML demos

- data dashboards
- data uploaders 
- admin panels
- prototyping apps
