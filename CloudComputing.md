## Basic Cloud Computing Vocabulary
- What is scalability? What is vertical and horizontal scaling?

- What is cloud computing?
- What is the difference between On-Premises Servers and Cloud Servers?
- What is a deployment model, and what is service model?
- What is the difference between public, provate, and hybrid cloud (service models)?
- What is load balancing and what is auto-scaling?

## Benefits of Cloud Computing
- What makes cloud computing more secure and scalable and less costly?

- How does Event Driven Architecture improve traditional Request/Response protocol?
- What is a container? How do ECS and EKS handle containers?
- How does a traditional network differ from a cloud network like AWS in physical structure? 
## "Serverless" Explained
- AWS Lambda helps users in what way? 

- AWS Opensearch redefines Serverless. What does this service provide, and how is it problematic?
## Scaling
- What is vertical scaling? What is horizontal scaling?

- What is the problem with vertical scaling?
- What are the ways that horizontal scaling solves these problems?
- What is load balancing?
- What is auto-scaling?
## Event Driven Architecture
- Event Driven Architecture vs. Request/Response?

- What is the publisher and what is the subsriber of the data?
## Container Orchestration
- What is a container? What services allow you to deploy containers? 

- How do ECS and EKS handle containers?
## Storage
- What is storage? What can you store? 

- What is object stroage? What is block storage? 
- What are databases? What is the differnece between SQL (realtional) and NoSQL databases?
## More benefits and deeper vocabularity
- What is availability? With services like Azure or AWS, what is the usual availability percentage? How do they maximize their availability?

- What is durability? How do services like AWS make sure data isn't lost?
- What is IAC? What does it mean? What problem does it solve? 
## Services Compared
Generally speaking...
- AWS is most comprehensive but hard to use. Its reliable.

- Azure has a much better UE but slightly less comprehensive as AWS. Strong in ML.
- GCP is cheap and simple. Great for startups and programmers.

## Strategies
- What are the uncomfortable drawbacks of cloud computing? What are the drawbacks of on-premise servers?

- What is a possible solution? How can you use PostgreSQL (portable) and employ a multi-cloud strategy?
- How could you use both on-premise servers and the cloud at the same time?
- Want AWS minus the pain of the bad UE? Use Vercel. The problem is that it is more expensive.
