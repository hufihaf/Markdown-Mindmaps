## Benefits of Cloud Computing
- What makes cloud computing more secure and scalable and less costly?

- How does Event Driven Architecture improve traditional Request/Response protocol?
- What is a container? How do ECS and EKS handle containers?
- How does a traditional network differ from a cloud network like AWS in physical structure? 
## "Serverless" Explained
- AWS Lambda helps users in what way? 

- AWS Opensearch redefines Serverless. What does this service provide, and how is it problematic?
## Scaling
- What is vertical scaling? What is horizontal scaling?

- What is the problem with vertical scaling?
- What are the ways that horizontal scaling solves these problems?
- What is load balancing?

## Event Driven Architecture
- Event Driven Architecture vs. Request/Response?

- What is the publisher and what is the subsriber of the data?
