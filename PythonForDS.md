## Overview
### Python Strengths
- Is Python a high-level (simple syntax) or a low-level (like C) programming language? How does this help the language's ecosystem?

- Why does Python have so many libraries and contributors? Why are there many DS-Specific libraries?
- What frameworks make Python particularly useful for making machine learning and deep learning models?
### Comparison to Other Languages
- **R** - Between R and Python, which is better for pure statistical modeling, and which is better at ML production and general-purpose programming?

- **Julia** - Which language has more mature libraries, and which is faster at numerical computation?
- **Scala (with Spark)** - Which language is better for distributed big data processing?
- What makes Python the most popular overall? Why would one choose to use one of these languages over Python on a given project?
## Libraries
### Data Manipulation
- **NumPy** - how does this library help with numerical operations and data manipulation?

- **Pandas** - what toold does Pandas provide that help with Data Manipulation?
### Data Visualization
- **Seaborn** - Why would one use this tool over Matplotlib?

- **Matplotlib** - Why would one use this toll over Seaborn?
## AI Frameworks
- **Scikit-Learn** - Is this library easy to use? What type of models is it capable of making?

- **TensorFlow** - What do this framework and PyTorch have that Scikit-learn does not? What makes this framework more attractive to industries?
- **PyTorch** - What makes this framework more attractive to researchers?
## Enviroments
- **Visual Studio Code** - What makes this enviroment so ubiquitous in Computer Science?

- **Jupyter Notebooks** - What makes this enviroment preferable to VS Code for Data Science?
- **Google Collaboratory** - How does this enviroment differ from Jupyter Notebooks? What hardware is being used to make computations? How does the AI work?
