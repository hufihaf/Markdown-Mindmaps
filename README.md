# Markdown Mindmaps
## Context
During my first internship, I was taught to approach learning in a manner different from the usual curriculum/note-taking style. A decent strategy to keep yourself informed is to select a topic, research the general domains, ask every question you have about the domains, then generate your own curriculum.

This process forces you to think in a new way. The questions you write help you stay interested, and the curriculum generation forces you to think critically about the importance of the questions you wrote and about how to organize them.

Phil Colins once said, "In learning you will teach, and in teaching you will learn." This mindmap generation strategy helps you do both.

## Content
In this repo you'll see some of the curriculums/mindmaps that I have made.

I encourage you to read the files that cover topics you would like to learn about. You can also use these files to test your knowledge.

## Chronology
I started this practice in May 2025. I want to see how long I can keep using this strategy. Hopefully, if this strategy is good enough, I'll make these for years.

Computer Science is a field that requires continual thinking and learning. Every day, someone somewhere innovates. Consider this a strategy to stay on top of things.
