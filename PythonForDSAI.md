## Machine Learning Fundamentals
- Define your terms. How do the terms AI, ML, DL, and LLM relate to eachother?

- What are features and labels?
- What are supervised models, and how do they differ from unsupervised models?
- Bonus: what is reinforcement learning?
- What is different between the training phase and the testing phase?
- How do algorithms like linear regression and k-means work?
- How do you evaluate models (accuracy, precision, recall, F1)?
- What is cross-validation and why is it important?

## TensorFlow Basics
- What are graphs and sessions?

- What is a tensor? How is it different from a scalar, matrix, or vector?
- What is "rank" when referring to a tensor object?
- What is Categorical data vs Numerical data?
- What are batches and epochs?
- What is overfitting?

## Core Learning Algorithms
- What is Linear Regression? When is it used?

- What is Classification?
- What is Clustering? On a basic level, have an understanding of how K-Means works (centroids, cluster, repeat until clusters are solidified)
- What sort of data do Hidden Markov Models take in? What do they output?

## Neural Networks in TensorFlow
- What are input layers, output layers, and hidden layers?

- How many output neurons should there be?
- How many input neurons should there be?
- What are weights?
- What is a densely connected NN?
- What is a bias?
- What is an activation function? There are three primary ones: relu, tanh, and sigmoid. What is the range of numbers they output?
- What is loss?

## Beyond
- Computer Vision - What is convolution? How is this method better than putting all of the pixel values into a list?

- Natural Language Processing - What is sentiment analysis? What is character generation?
- Reinforcement Learning - How does it work?

## TensorFlow and Pytorch Compared
- Tools like ONNX allow users of either framework to do what?

- Which framework is more user friendly, has tools for each step in the development of a model, and has various specialized libraries (TTS, audio processing, computer vision, etc)?
- Which framework has pre-trained models available for fine tuning, has better tools for reinforcement learning models, and has a faster runtime overall in model deploment?
- What framework is best for an absolute beginner? Answer is Keras (API that is integrated with the TF framework), but what about after that?
